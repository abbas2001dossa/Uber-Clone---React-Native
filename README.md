# Uber-Clone---React-Native

# Description : 
  I developed a React Native app that closely mimics the functionality of the popular Uber app, providing users with a seamless and efficient ride-hailing     
  experience. Leveraging Google APIs, the app offers advanced location services, precise mapping, and real-time navigation to create a reliable transportation 
  platform.
